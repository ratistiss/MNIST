# MNIST
Created from a tutorial, with tweaks I added. 
This uses the Keras library which is built on tensorflow.
The data set MNIST is a data set of hand drawn images.
Even though I still dont understand why, using a mix of
Relu on the first layer and Sigmoid on the second layer made my prdeiction slightly more accurate.
